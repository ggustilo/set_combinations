# SetCombos

Set combos is a gem that takes an external txt menu file, sets up a digital 'bistro' from that menu, and will allow the user to find different combinations of items that add up to a total.

To run the test file from the root folder, run:
ruby lib/runner.rb

At the prompt for filepath, enter:
test_menu.txt

Then follow console instructions.
